# Picon

`picon` runs your code in python interactive console from the command line.
Besides other purposes, it can be easily integrated to your editor to create a live worksheet environment.
This is useful to evaluate your code on the fly and show you the result right below the code within your editor:

## Usage

`picon` is implemented as a thin wrapper around [code](https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html) module to be used as a command line application.
There are three running modes available in `picon`.
Following example code is used for demonstration:

    $ cat demo.py
    'hello world'

    x = 42
    x
    print x

    y

    total = 0
    for i in range(1000):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            total += i

    total

Default mode evaluates the code and only shows the output.
This is similar to running your code with `python` but it uses interactive console semantics (see syntax section below):

    $ picon demo.py
    'hello world'
    42
    42
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'y' is not defined
    233168

Live mode shows the code and the output as in a live session.
This can be used to prepare programming notes or documentation:

    $ picon demo.py -l
    >>> 'hello world'
    'hello world'
    >>>
    >>> x = 42
    >>> x
    42
    >>> print x
    42
    >>>
    >>> y
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'y' is not defined
    >>>
    >>> total = 0
    >>> for i in range(1000):
    ...     if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
    ...         total += i
    ...
    >>> total
    233168

Append mode appends the output as comments below the code.
A pipe character (`|`) is added to differentiate these comments from regular ones and strip them in consequent executions.
This mode is designed to be integrated to editors to create a live worksheet environment:

    $ picon demo.py -a
    'hello world'
    #|'hello world'

    x = 42
    x
    #|42
    print x
    #|42

    y
    #|Traceback (most recent call last):
    #|  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
    #|NameError: name 'y' is not defined

    total = 0
    for i in range(1000):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            total += i

    total
    #|233168

## Syntax

Syntax of python interactive console differs from regular python in two main aspects.
First, return values are automatically shown without a `print` statement:

    $ cat return.py
    x = 42
    x
    print x
    $ python return.py
    42
    $ picon return.py
    42
    42

Second, blocks are separated with blank newlines in addition to indentation:

    $ cat block.py
    if True:
        print 'one'

        print 'two'
    $ python block.py
    one
    two
    $ picon block.py
    one
      File "<console>", line 1
        print 'two'
        ^
    IndentationError: unexpected indent

Having blank trailing spaces equal to the indentation works in interactive console but not in `picon`.

## Installation

You can install `picon` as a python package using `pip`:

    pip install picon

Or you can download it from github and put it somewhere in `$PATH`:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gokcehan/picon/master/picon/picon.py -o picon
    chmod +x picon
    sudo mv picon /usr/local/bin

## Vim Integration

Simply running `:%!picon -a` evaluates the buffer content and puts the output as comments below the code.
In order to keep the cursor position fixed and join undo operations to a single step you can add a command similar to the following to the file `~/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim`:

    if executable('picon')
    	command! -buffer -range=% Picon exe 'normal m`' | silent! undojoin | exe '<line1>,<line2>' . '!picon -a' | exe 'normal ``'
    endif

You may want to assign this command to either `BufWritePre` event to run on save and/or `CursorHold` event to run on idle as follows (see also `:h updatetime`):

    autocmd BufWritePre <buffer> Picon
    autocmd CursorHold  <buffer> Picon
